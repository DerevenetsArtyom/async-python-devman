* ## [1. Game about space and what is going on there...](01.async_console_game/README.md)
    Simple console game about the spaceship in open space. Based on coroutines with using `curses` module.  
    Points were implemented: 
    * own custom game engine
    * animation of stars and ship
    * user interaction via arrow keys on the keyboard
* ## [2. Through garbage to stars!](02.through_garbage_to_stars/README.md)
    The first part of the game turned out to be relaxing and meditatively utopian, so fans of actions will call it boring.  
    It's time to add a mode with guns: explosions, asteroids, satellites, hot pieces of plating.  

    Transfer the players in 2000 - satellite, garbage and coke bottles.  
    Let them dodge obstacles and think about the behavior of humanity!  
    
    And when it comes to understanding - put everyone in 2020.  
    And give the laser gun on the rocket nose.  
    Let the players together annihilate the rubbish heaps, freeing up space for new great achievements.  
    Points were implemented: 
     * custom garbage generator
     * add ability to explode garbage with embedded gun
     * improved movement mechanics of spaceship
     * calculating collisions of spaceship with obstacles
     * game becomes harder as time goes by
